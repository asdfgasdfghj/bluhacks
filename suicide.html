            Suicide is the act of intentionally ending one's own life. 
            It is a complex phenomenon influenced by various factors including mental health conditions, social, cultural, and environmental factors, as well as individual experiences and circumstances. 
            Suicide is a serious public health issue worldwide, with significant social, emotional, and economic consequences for individuals, families, and communities. 
            It is important to understand that suicidal behavior often stems from deep emotional pain and a sense of hopelessness, rather than a rational decision-making process. 
            Suicide can affect individuals of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds. 
            While mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse are common risk factors for suicide, it's important to recognize that not everyone who experiences mental illness will have suicidal thoughts or tendencies.
